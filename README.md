# Woke Content Detector Analysis

# Overview

A project to analyse the [Woke Content Detector](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AVTZPJij5PQmlWAkYdDahBrxDiwqWMGsWEcEnpdKTa4/edit?gid=0#gid=0), a list of video games classified into how 'woke' they are. 

# Eventual Goals

- Attempt to establish what 'woke' is according to the creators of the WCD.
- Combine this list with other data on video games (e.g. sales, critic and user reviews etc.) to gather insights on how the 'wokeness' of a game affects its commercial success.
- Create a dashboard to visualise all of these insights.
